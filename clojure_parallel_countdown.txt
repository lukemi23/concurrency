;; You will likely see the countdown from 200 begin and make some progress
;; before the countdown from 199 begins concurrently.
(prn(parallel_countdown '(200 199)))


;; Works with any number of agents (though decrements always by 2).
;; You will likely see all three countdowns from 200 start before the first finishes.
(prn (parallel_countdown '(200 200 200)))
